# Sports_Analyzer
Third year college assignment for experimenting with multi-threading using POSIX.

## Objective
Develop a multithreaded application that analyzes sports statistics using POSIX threads.
 	
 The project will focus on:
 * parallel programming techniques
 * synchronization mechanisms
 * producer-consumer model
 * semaphores
 * callbacks
 * strategies to avoid deadlocks

 Processing a large dataset of sports statistics (performance data, game scores, etc.), the program will use multiple threads to perform various computations in parallel. The presented thread structure is not mandatory, but aim to implement a producer-consumer model.
